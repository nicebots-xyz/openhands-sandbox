# OpenHands Sandbox

## Purpose
The OpenHands Sandbox repository contains business code for nicebots.xyz. It is used in conjunction with [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/) to integrate OpenHands with our developer workflow tools at nicebots.xyz.

## Key Components
- **Dockerfile**: Sets up the environment with necessary tools and utilities.
- **Utilities**: Includes `uv`, `pdm`, and `copywrite` for package management and other functionalities.

## Usage
This repository can be used to test and experiment with different configurations and tools in a sandboxed environment. It is ideal for developers looking to explore new tools without affecting their main development setup.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests. Your feedback and contributions are welcome to improve the functionality and usability of this sandbox environment.
